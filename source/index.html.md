# Introduction

 Bienvenido a la documentaciÃ³n de apis de loadingplay

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your API key.

Loadingplay uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Loadingplay API key at our [developer contact](mailto:ricardo@loadingplay.com).

The API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN</code> with your personal API key.
